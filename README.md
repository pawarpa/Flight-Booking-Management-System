# Flight Booking Management System - Database Design and Implementation

## Research question or challenge
The primary challenge addressed in this project was the design and implementation of an industry-level Flight Booking
Management System. The research question revolved around how to architect a database system that efficiently
handles flight bookings, seat reservations, and passenger information.

## Approach and methodology
Tools: SQL, SSMS, ER Studio, Tableau
1. Database Design: The project commenced with the creation of an entity-relationship diagram (ERD) to model the
database's structure. This involved identifying essential entities, relationships, and attributes, such as flights,
passengers, reservations, and airports.
2. Database Implementation: Following the ERD design, the next step involved implementing the database using SQL.
I created tables, established relationships, and defined data integrity constraints.
3. Functionalities Implementation: Beyond database design, I implemented various functionalities. This included the
creation of stored procedures, user-defined functions, triggers, views, and indexes to manage different aspects of
the flight booking system.
4. Integration with Tableau: To provide real-time visualization of flight information, reservations, and passenger data,
the SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) database was seamlessly integrated with Tableau. This integration
allowed for the creation of interactive dashboards to monitor reservations and flight information.
5. Quality Assurance: Rigorous testing and validation processes were undertaken to ensure the accuracy and
consistency of the database. Data validation scripts were created to maintain data integrity.

## Findings and their significance
1. Efficient Database Structure: The designed database offered a robust and efficient structure for storing and
managing flight booking data. It provided a comprehensive framework for recording and retrieving information
about flights, passengers, reservations, and airports.
2. Data Integrity and Consistency: The implementation of data integrity constraints, checks, and validation scripts
ensured the reliability and consistency of the data. This was critical to preventing errors and discrepancies in the flight
booking system.
3. Real-Time Data Visualization: The integration of the database with Tableau allowed for the creation of interactive
dashboards. These dashboards provided real-time insights into flight availability, reservations, and passenger
information, and other critical data. This feature enhanced the decision-making capabilities of the system.
4. User-Friendly Functionality: The implemented stored procedures and triggers automated various processes,
making the system user-friendly for airline staff and passengers. For example, triggers ensured that seat availability
was updated in real-time as bookings were made.
5. Industry-Standard Solution: The project aimed to create a database system that adhered to industry standards for
flight booking management. Such a system can be employed by airlines and travel agencies to streamline their
booking processes, ultimately enhancing their efficiency and customer service.
